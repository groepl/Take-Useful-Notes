# The Minimalist's Zettelkasten
_Stop drowning in notes. Start thinking clearly._ - Most productivity systems promise to help you capture everything. This book offers something better: the courage to capture almost nothing.

The Minimalist's Zettelkasten strips the popular note-taking method down to its essence—three simple moves repeated over time. No complicated software. No thousand-note archives. No digital hoarding disguised as knowledge work.

The provided podcast from NotebookLM consists of excerpts from a book titled "The Minimalist’s Zettelkasten: Think Better with Less", authored by Edmund Gröpl. It is set to be independently published in early 2026.

## Sketchnotes
Sketchnotes are a way of taking notes using drawings and illustrations, along with words. The sketchnote concept was coined by Mike Rohde and allows you to add visual element to your notes, making it more engaging, memorable and easy to understand the subject.

## Obsidian
Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management app from Shida Li and Erica Xu. It works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files and lets you turn a collection of plain text files into a rich network of linked thought.

## Zettelkasten
Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing created by Niklas Luhmann. It has hypertextual features to make a web of thought possible. The difference to other systems is that you create a web of thoughts instead of notes of arbitrary size and form, and emphasize connection, not a collection.
